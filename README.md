# Bank Customer Segmentation Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project segments bank customers based on demographic and transactional data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enhance marketing strategies and personalize banking services.  

## Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes patterns, detects outliers, and ensures data quality.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses PCA to simplify data while preserving key insights.  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Applies K-Means clustering to group customers based on behavior.  
- **Visualization:** Generates charts and graphs to interpret customer clusters.  
- **Scalability:** Can be adapted for different financial datasets to analyze customer behavior.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Processing & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning & Clustering:** Scikit-learn (PCA & K-Means clustering)  
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
